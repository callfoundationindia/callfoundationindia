As our name CALL – Comprehensive Action in Life and Livelihood suggests, CALL Foundation is
dedicated to coming up with professional solutions helpful in tackling the issues and enhancement
of quality of life and livelihood.


Our journey started when the entire world was busy handling the severity of the COVID 19 pandemic
with a series of phone calls and video calls. While we all were at our native places and had a break
for some time to notice what all has changed around us while we changed from kids to adults, we
noticed that some things are still the same. In fact, with the ongoing pandemic, we could notice the
chaos it had created in the seemingly normal lives otherwise. The entire situation of migration of
workforce and the lack of jobs in market clubbed with the already prevalent issues of unemployment
and low levels of development in underprivileged areas shouted for the need of sustainable
communities. This is where we had our thoughts aligned and had a series of discussions on the
ongoing issues we were able to observe around us and how we felt we could be an asset in resolving
them.


Thus was born the CALL Foundation.
