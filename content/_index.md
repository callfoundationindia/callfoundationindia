      Comprehensive Action for Life and Livelihood

      #### **Our Mission**


      ##### &#xA;CALL Foundation aims to support the development of community
      businesses, micro-entrepreneurs&#xA;through professional advice and
      solutions and provide means of linkages between businesses,&#xA;research,
      and educational institutes and markets.




      #### **Our Vision**


      ##### &#xA;Our vision is to drive the creation of self-sustainable
      communities through comprehensive action in&#xA;life and livelihood.


      #### &#xA;**Our Story**


      ##### &#xA;As our name CALL â€“ Comprehensive Action in Life and Livelihood
      suggests, CALL Foundation is&#xA;dedicated to coming up with professional
      solutions helpful in tackling the issues and enhancement&#xA;of quality of
      life and livelihood.


      ##### &#xA;Our journey started when the entire world was busy handling the
      severity of the COVID 19 pandemic&#xA;with a series of phone calls and
      video calls. While we all were at our native places and had a
      break&#xA;for some time to notice what all has changed around us while we
      changed from kids to adults, we&#xA;noticed that some things are still the
      same. In fact, with the ongoing pandemic, we could notice the&#xA;chaos it
      had created in the seemingly normal lives otherwise. The entire situation
      of migration of&#xA;workforce and the lack of jobs in market clubbed with
      the already prevalent issues of unemployment&#xA;and low levels of
      development in underprivileged areas shouted for the need of
      sustainable&#xA;communities. This is where we had our thoughts aligned and
      had a series of discussions on the&#xA;ongoing issues we were able to
      observe around us and how we felt we could be an asset in
      resolving&#xA;them.


      ##### &#xA;Thus was born the CALL Foundation.
